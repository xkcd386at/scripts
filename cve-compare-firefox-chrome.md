I got tired of people posting a link to something written by a guy called
madaidans, about firefox security vis-a-vis chrome, claiming that chrome is
much more secure because of some very fundamental design issues

I distinctly recall at least **FOUR** zero-days for chrome in the last few
weeks/months, and none at all for firefox, so I got pissed off seeing the same
rubbish every few days from someone else who has discovered that url

anyway, that url is the "theory", but we know theory and practice don't always
match

here's the "practice".  Just download the CVE data for 2021, from
https://nvd.nist.gov/feeds/json/cve/1.1/nvdcve-1.1-2021.json.gz (or indeed any
other similar file from https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds -- different time
periods are available), then run this program (same name as this file, but
without the ".md" at the end) on it

the numbers for 2021 (up until today, 2021-10-11) are:

                CRITICAL    HIGH        MEDIUM
    chrome      20          154         67
    firefox     1           39          40

look at the numbers for "CRITICAL" -- that's a heck of a lot of CRITICAL
issues for something that has fundamental design superiority over firefox
